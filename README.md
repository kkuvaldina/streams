# Colored Icon

The `Colored Icon` component extends the usage of the fabric icon. Instead of being limited to brand colors or fabric gray10 you can now pass in any fabric named color (that arenâ€™t themes at this time).

```javascript
import { ColoredIcon } from 'colored-icon';

<ColoredIcon
    classes="EmploymentSubtitles__subTitleIcon"
    fabricColorName="gray7"
    iconName="fab-employees-14x12"
/>
```

Here are the properties it is looking for:

```javascript
{
	classes?: string;
	fabricColorName: string;
	iconName: string;
}

```
The `classes` prop is to allow for hooks to do what you need with the icon. The `fabricColorName` must match one of the predefined fabric named colors as seen in the example. `iconName` must follow the same naming convention as fabric icon.

The component will return a `<span>` with the fabric icon inside. Inline styles are used to color the icon.
